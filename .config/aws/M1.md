### What is Cloud Computing?
- On demand delivery
- Hybrid Cloud


The six main benefits of cloud computing with AWS are:  

1. **Pay-as-you-go pricing:** Replaces large upfront fixed costs with variable expenses, allowing businesses to start small and pay only for what they use.  
2. **Economies of scale:** AWSâ€™s large-scale hardware purchases lower costs, which are passed on to customers.  
3. **No need to guess capacity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly based on actual demand, avoiding under- or over-provisioning.  
4. **Increased speed and agility:** Users can rapidly create and delete test environments, enabling faster innovation without wasted spending.  
5. **Reduced maintenance costs:** AWS handles running and maintaining data centers, freeing businesses to focus on customers rather than infrastructure.  
6. **Global reach in minutes:** Businesses can deploy applications worldwide instantly through AWS Regions, bypassing lengthy traditional expansions.  

Together, these benefits enable cost savings, efficiency, flexibility, and access to a vast global infrastructure.

AWS's global infrastructure ensures high availability and fault tolerance, crucial for minimizing downtime and maintaining application accessibility. Analogous to a coffee shop chain with multiple locations, AWS operates in multiple Regions around the world, each containing three or more Availability Zones (AZs) for redundancy. AZs are physically separated to prevent simultaneous failure, and each contains one or more data centers with redundant power and connectivity. Businesses can operate across multiple Regions to achieve disaster-proof operations, enabling failover to another Region if one experiences outages, ensuring continuous service and income generation.

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model dictates that both AWS and the customer are responsible for security. AWS is responsible for the security *of* the cloud, handling the physical, network, and hypervisor layers. The customer is responsible for security *in* the cloud, including the operating system, applications, and data. Customers have full control over their OS, applications, and data, including patching the OS, securing applications, controlling data access, and encrypting data. The model ensures a secure environment through this division of labor, with responsibility shifting based on the AWS service used.
